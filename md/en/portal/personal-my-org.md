> **Special Note**: If you are the creator of a team/organization, for the sake of the stability of organization management, you cannot directly withdraw from the organization. If you wish to no longer serve as the creator, you can transfer the ownership of the organization to other suitable members through [Transferring Ownership](/protal/org-transfer) to achieve a smooth transition of the organization management relationship.
