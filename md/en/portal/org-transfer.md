# Transfer Team/Organization Ownership  

This section details the specific procedures for transferring ownership of a team/organization.  

## Application Scenarios  

The **Transfer Team/Organization** feature is used when:  
- The current **owner** needs to leave the team for specific reasons.  
- The team needs to be fully handed over to a target client.  

## Operation Steps  

1. Open the **Team Settings** page and click the **Transfer Organization** button. A transfer panel will appear.

2. In the panel, enter the email or name of the intended recipient. The platform will automatically search for matching users. After selecting the target user, click the **Submit** button. The system will then request account credentials to verify the authorization of this operation.  

> **Note**: There is an option labeled **Leave the organization after transferring ownership**. If selected, the original owner will automatically leave the team after the ownership transfer is completed. If not selected, the original owner will be downgraded to a **Developer** role. During the organization transfer process, the permissions of other members in the organization will remain unchanged.
