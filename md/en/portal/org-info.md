When we enter the home page of a team/organization, we can view the basic information of the current team here, including information such as the team name, team introduction, team members, README, and team repositories.

### Team Repositories

Here, we can quickly understand the number of repositories under the current team as well as the basic status of the repositories.

When we click on the `Repositories` menu or click on `View More` in the repository panel on the team home page, we can jump to the team/organization repository list page. This page provides more flexible query and filtering functions, allowing for precise query and filtering according to conditions such as repository type and classification.
