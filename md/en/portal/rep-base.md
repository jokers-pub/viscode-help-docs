## Repository Information Modification  

During repository management, adjusting and updating repository information based on actual requirements is a common task. This chapter provides a detailed guide on modifying repository information, including the editable fields supported by the platform, to help you manage repositories more flexibly and efficiently.  

### Accessing the Repository Editing Page  

1. **Locate the Repository Settings Page**: First, navigate to and open the repository you wish to modify. On the repository page, locate and enter the repository settings page—the central hub for configuring and managing repositories.  
2. **Click the "Basic Information" Menu**: After entering the repository settings page, find and click the "Basic Information" option in the left-hand menu. This will open the repository information editing interface, where you can update basic repository details.

### Editable Content  

1. **Repository Name**: In this section, you can update the repository name. Note that repository names must consist of English letters and be unique within the team, ensuring accurate identification and distinction.  
2. **Project Title**: The project title provides a brief description of the repository. It helps users quickly grasp the repository’s purpose and serves as the `title` data for code generation, offering crucial context.  
3. **Homepage URL**: Enter an external website URL here, allowing users to access relevant resources or web pages directly.  
4. **Repository Tags**: By maintaining repository tags, viewers can quickly assess its business scope. Tags also enhance searchability, enabling precise repository discovery.  
5. **Repository Description**: Provide a detailed textual description of the repository’s purpose, functionality, and objectives. This helps newcomers understand its core aspects efficiently.  
6. **Mandatory Commit Messages**: This option is disabled by default. When enabled, developers must include an update log when saving changes in the workspace. This promotes standardized documentation for traceability.  
7. **Set as Private Repository**: Configure whether the repository is private based on your needs. Private repositories restrict access to authorized personnel, ensuring data security and privacy.  
8. **Set an Icon**: Upload a unique and representative icon for the repository. A distinct icon improves recognition and differentiation in listings.
