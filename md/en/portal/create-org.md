### Filling in Team Information

In the pop-up window for creating an organization/team, you'll need to enter the organization's name, nickname, and a brief description. Then click the "Confirm" button to complete the creation.

- **Organization Name**: Must be entered in English letters. This name will serve as the unique identifier for the team, ensuring precise distinction and uniqueness across the platform.  
- **Organization Nickname**: Allows you to assign an alias to the team. It is recommended to use concise and intuitive phrasing for easy recognition and memorization by team members and stakeholders.  

> Important Note: The organization name must be unique across the entire platform, as it serves as the sole identifier for your organization/team.

After clicking "Submit" to finalize the creation of your `organization/team`, the platform will automatically generate a team homepage where you can view and manage all team-related content, including the team's nickname, README, avatar, repositories, team members, and more.
