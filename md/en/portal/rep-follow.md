## Follow Repository

This chapter details the methods for following a repository and the ways to view followed repositories.

### How to Follow a Repository

In the repository list—whether it is the recommended repository list, team repository list, or repository detail page—there is a "Follow" button. Simply click the button to easily follow the corresponding repository. When the button icon is lit up, it indicates that the repository has been successfully added to your follow list.

### View Followed Repositories

After successfully following a repository, you can quickly access the followed repositories through the following two methods:

1. **Portal Home Page**: On the portal home page, you will see the "My Followed Repositories" panel. Here, you can directly click to enter the detail pages of each followed repository for convenient access to repository information.
2. **Personal Panel**: In the personal panel, find the "Followed Repositories" menu. Clicking it will display the complete list of all followed repositories, facilitating centralized management and search.
