### Modifying the Password

1. **Enter the Original Password**: After entering the password modification page, you will see a form, and first of all, you need to enter the original password that you are currently using. This step is to verify your identity and ensure that only the account owner himself/herself can perform the password modification operation, preventing others from unauthorized password changes.
2. **Set the New Password**: After entering the correct original password, you then need to enter the new password you want to set in the corresponding input box. The new password should follow the password rules set by the platform. Usually, it is required to contain a certain length and a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters to enhance the strength and security of the password.
3. **Verification and Confirmation**: After entering the new password, the system will require you to enter the new password again for verification to avoid password setting failures due to input errors. When the two newly entered passwords are exactly the same and pass the system's format and strength verification, click on the "Confirm Modification" or a similar button to complete the password modification operation. At this time, your account will use the newly set password for login verification, effectively improving the security of your account.

Through the above simple yet rigorous steps, you can easily complete the modification of your personal password on the platform and add an extra layer of security to your account.
