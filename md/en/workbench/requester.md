## Request Management  

This chapter primarily explains how to manage API interfaces in front-end application projects and how to quickly implement requests through a visual approach.  

### Overview  

The Request Management feature is only available in repositories of the **Frontend - Application** type. As an actual implementation project, it allows for the unified management and maintenance of API interfaces.  

You can open this feature by clicking the **Service Interfaces** menu in the right-side panel.

### Create/Edit an Interface  

On the Request Management page, you can create a new service interface by clicking the **New Interface** button in the **top-right corner** or edit an existing one by clicking the **Edit** button in the interface list.

When the interface editing window opens, the following elements need to be maintained:

1. **Interface URL**: Enter the interface URL here. Do not include the domain nameâ€”the request base URL can be configured in environment variables.  
2. **Request Type**: Click the dropdown before the URL input field to switch the request type (currently supports **POST** and **GET**).  
3. **Title**: A brief title helps developers quickly understand the interface's purpose.  
4. **Description**: Detailed interface information to help developers gain a deeper understanding.  
5. **Input Fields**: Click **Add Parameter** or edit an existing input parameter.  
6. **Output Fields**: Click **Add Parameter** or edit an existing output parameter.  

> Once an interface is created, the platform automatically categorizes it based on the file hierarchy for better management.  
> For multi-environment base URL configuration, refer to the **requesterRoot** variable in the [Environment Variables](/workbench/env) documentation.  

### Import/Update  

The platform provides a quick interface import/update feature, allowing you to rapidly import all API interfaces from existing, accessible backend projects.

Click the **Import/Update** button in the top-right corner to open the import panel. Enter the name of the backend repository to search for the target project.

Only backend projects accessible to the current user will be displayed. After selecting a backend project, you can choose a version (e.g., the **DEV** development version).  

Once selected, you can click **Import/Update** to import individual interfaces or controllers, or use the **Sync All** button to synchronize all backend interfaces.  

> If the imported interface URL already exists, it will only update the input/output fields without modifying **MOCK** data. If the data structure changes, update the MOCK data promptly.  

### Interface Input  

Click **Add Parameter** to define input fields:

For detailed field creation, refer to: [Field Maintenance](/workbench/property)  

### Interface Output  

The output section defines the data structure returned by an interface. Click the **Output** tab to manage output fields.

For detailed field creation, refer to: [Field Maintenance](/workbench/property)  

Beyond manual field creation, the platform supports **JSON auto-parsing**. Simply paste a sample JSON response, and the system will automatically extract the fields.

### MOCK Data  

The JOKER development platform includes MOCK capabilities, enabling realistic test data generation using Mock.js syntax.

In addition to Mock.js syntax, manual MOCK data customization is supported, along with **conditional branching** for advanced use cases.

> Condition-based MOCK data allows you to control data variability based on specific logic (e.g., simulating success/failure responses).  

### Global Request Management  

Click the **Global Request Management** tab in the request editor to configure:

Key configurations:  

- **Timeout**: Default is 10s (override per request if needed).  
- **Data Transformation**: Modify request/response formats to adapt to different backend standards.  
- **Status Validation**: (Recommended) Define logic to distinguish between business success/failure. If unset, all non-network errors are treated as successes.  
- **Global Error Handling**: (Recommended) Centralize error handling (e.g., showing error popups). Return `true` in the `Error` method to bypass this.  
- **Custom Configs**: Add specialized options (e.g., enabling loading animations).  
- **Request Interceptors**: Use pre/post/error hooks for tasks like displaying loading states.  

### How to Call an Interface  

After defining an interface, use the **Data Request** node in any method editor to invoke it:
