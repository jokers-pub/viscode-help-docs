## Global Variables  

Global variables allow developers to create unified variables that can be shared and used across multiple files within a project.  

### Overview  

Global variables help solve the problem of variable sharing across different files. They can be accessed and modified in any file. Moreover, if your project is a component/method set, data isolation is effectively maintained in the referencing environment when the project is imported.  

Global variables can be managed via the **Global Variables** panel in the `Project Configuration` file.
