## Global Variables

Global variables allow developers to create unified global variables within a project and share them among multiple files.

### Overview

Global variables are helpful in solving the problem of variable sharing across files. In different files, we can both access global variables and modify their values. Moreover, if your project is a component/method set, when it is referenced, effective data isolation will also be achieved in the project reference environment.

We can maintain variables through the **Global Variables** panel in the `Project Configuration` file.
