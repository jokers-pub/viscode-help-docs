</ol>
<h3>Changing Your Password</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Enter Your Current Password</strong>: Upon accessing the password change page, you will encounter a form that first requires you to input your current password. This step serves to verify your identity, ensuring that only the account owner can perform the password modification and preventing unauthorized access.</li>
<li><strong>Set a New Password</strong>: After correctly entering your current password, proceed to input your desired new password in the designated field. The new password must adhere to the platform's security requirements, which typically include a minimum length and a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters to enhance strength and security.</li>
<li><strong>Confirmation and Verification</strong>: After entering the new password, the system will prompt you to re-enter it for validation to avoid errors. Once both entries match and pass the platformâ€™s format and strength checks, click the &quot;Confirm Change&quot; or equivalent button to finalize the modification. At this point, your account will use the newly set password for authentication, significantly improving security.</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these straightforward yet rigorous steps, you can effortlessly update your personal password on the platform, reinforcing the security of your account.</p>
