<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong>: If you are the <strong>creator</strong> of an organization, direct exit is restricted for administrative stability. To relinquish ownership, you must <a href="/portal/org-transfer" target="_blank">transfer control</a> to another member first. This ensures a seamless transition in governance.</p>
